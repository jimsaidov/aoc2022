My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022][aoc]. Just for fun :) 
# Note
This code is not intended to be optimal, I might / would never write such code for anything productive. The whole purpose was to get the puzzles solved.

Sometimes things are really hardcoded based on the details of the puzzles. 

At some point, once I have some time, I might get back to the code and make some optimizations.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
